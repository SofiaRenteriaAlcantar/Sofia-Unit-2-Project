The case was filed in 1970 by a woman under the fictional name Jane Roe. The lawsuit argues that the law was unconstitutional becuase it violated the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/our-government/the-constitution/#:~:text=The%20First%20Amendment%20provides%20that,the%20right%20to%20bear%20arms.">first amendment,</a> <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-4/#:~:text=The%20right%20of%20the%20people,and%20the%20persons%20or%20things"> the fourth amendment,</a> <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-5/#:~:text=No%20person%20shall%20be%20held,the%20same%20offence%20to%20be"> the fifth amendment </a> , <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-9/#:~:text=The%20enumeration%20in%20the%20Constitution,others%20retained%20by%20the%20people."> the ninth amendment </a> , and <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/amendment-14/#:~:text=No%20State%20shall%20make%20or,equal%20protection%20of%20the%20laws."> the fourteenth amendment</a> . </p>
